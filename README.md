# 🌀 Portal

A real-time **portal simulation** with particle physics, gravity, and teleportation – all powered by **Processing / Java 17** 🚀

[Preview](https://ibb.co/KjJGv1Qw)

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🧲 Particles attracted by two stationary gravity wells (portals)
- 🔁 Teleportation mechanics between portals
- 🌈 Random RGB coloring for particles
- ⏱️ Anti-ping-pong logic (no rapid back-and-forth teleportation)
- 🖼️ Clean and interactive Processing-based UI

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- 🧠 Basic understanding of Processing and Java
- 💻 **Java 17** (64-bit)
- 🪟 **Windows OS** (Tested only on Windows)
- ✅ 64-bit CPU architecture

---

## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. Download **all source files** into the same directory:
   - `main.pde`
   - `cPortal.pde`
   - `Particle.pde`
2. Run `Portal.exe` if provided **OR** open the project in [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) and press `▶️` to run.

## 🧯 Common Issues

- ❗ *"Java not found / incompatible"*: Make sure you have **Java 17 (64-bit)** installed and properly configured in your system's PATH.
- ⚠️ *This project is not tested on macOS or Linux.*
- 🧪 *Particles not visible or teleporting weirdly?* Try adjusting the gravitational constant or particle size for your screen resolution.
